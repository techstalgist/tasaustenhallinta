#Development

1. Run npm start. It starts both client and server. Go to localhost:3000 to inspect the app.
When changes are made to the code, browser should automatically reload.

#PRODUCTION DEPLOY

1. Run ./deploy.sh to deploy. It will build the frontend first, move files to server and run backend build on server.
2. Run ./open_prod.sh to see the results live. Use Command+R for hard refresh.
